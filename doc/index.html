    <h1>trivial-irc - A Common Lisp IRC client library</h1>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
      trivial-irc is a (very) trivial IRC client library.  The current
      version is 0.0.1, and it has no facilities for CTCP, and only
      very simple facilities for receiving, handling and sending
      messages.  It might evolve over time, and it's my intention to
      keep the current API available, and to keep it asdf-installable.
    </p>

    <p>
      It has been tested on Allegro 8.1 and SBCL 1.0.18 on Linux.  It
      should work on any system that
      <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/usocket/">usocket</a>
      works on.
